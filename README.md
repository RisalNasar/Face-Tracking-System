Target Tracking System for a Directional Audio Beam Speaker

The Audio Beaming System developed in the Digital Signal Processing Laboratory at Nanyang Technological University is an innovative technology providing directional sound. This project serves as a value addition to the Audio Beaming System by designing and building a system to track a target as it moves around and thereby making it possible to beam directional audio continuously at the target.
 
 This project involves making a Target Tracking Application using a web camera, a host computer, a motorized pan and tilt system and a microcontroller. The application takes in live video input from the web camera and run computer vision codes on it. The computer vision codes analyzing the live video will track potential targets on the scene. The corresponding position data of the target will be handed over to the microcontroller. The microcontroller uses this data to control the pan and tilt system. The pan and tilt system will position the Audio Beaming System on the target. Only the moving target on the scene will be able to hear the audio being beamed.
 
 The Audio Beaming System with Target Tracking has tremendous applications in the gaming industry. Other areas of application are in marketing and advertisement, customer support, museums, crowd control, etc.
